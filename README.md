## Abstract  
Computational approaches have recently become popular in medicine, as simulations can help reduce the high cost of discovering and developing new drugs. Previous deep learning approaches have successfully predicted material properties from elemental composition. We extend this progress by developing NLP-based approaches using LSTMs and bag-of-words modelling to predict drug toxicity and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from SMILE sequences. We apply these techniques with minimal hyperparameter tuning, achieving similar results as those from biochemists with significant inductive bias. We further observe how various LSTM NLP-based approaches are effective at predicting ADRs, regardless of whether we add attention or bidirectionality. Ultimately, our data show that even with minimal drug-development domain knowledge, future NLP-based approaches analyzing chemical sequences have potential in advising drug adversity and safety.
